## My process
- I first examined the design or redline and mapped out how to implement the technologies I would use in order to most closely resemble the final product. Then I began with the HTML and moved onto the CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to apply flexbox and dove more into editing text sizes and using different units instead of just defaulting to px.
